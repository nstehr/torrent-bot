To run the torrent bot, first, make sure java is installed on your system, second, set the approriate variables in bot_config.py.  
Then, execute the run.sh shell script.

Currently, torrent bot needs to be run on the same machine as transmission daemon.

To find out the supported commands send the bot a "help" message.  

To download a torrent via torrent bot, use the download torrent command and pass it the url to the .torrent file on the tracker site.

Currently tested against transmission 1.51, built from source.

NOTE:

Before you can use Torrent Bot, you must create or already have an MSN account to be used with the script. 

If you add your bots email account to your buddy list, Torrent Bot should automatically add you in return.  If 
you run into problems and this doesn't seem to work, try manually logging in 
as the bot account and accept yourself as a friend. 
This may be confusing so below is some steps to try to help clarify:

Create an msn account for the bot. i.e my_bot@hotmail.com
login to your main account and add the bot account (i.e my_bot@hotmail.com) as a buddy
logout of your main account and login as the bot account
Add your main account as a buddy
login as your main account
